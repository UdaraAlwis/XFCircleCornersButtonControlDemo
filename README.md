# XFCircleCornersButtonControlDemo
Tech talk: Xamarin Forms Custom Renderers for the Rescue
This is the demo project of the tech talk I did, on Custom Renderers at the Dot Net Meetup, hosted by Microsoft April/2016 (http://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-SG/)

So basically what I showcased was how to create a Button that has Circled/Ellipsed Corners with Xamarin Forms Custom Renderers.
