# XFCircleCornersButtonControlDemo
This is the demo project I did on Custom Renderers at the Dot Net Meetup, hosted by Microsoft April/2016 http://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-SG/events/230193854/

So basically what I showcased was how to create a Button that has Circled/Ellipsed Corners with Xamarin Forms Custom Renderers.
